<h1>Vulnerability Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of running vulnerability scans using Nessus then performing vulnerability remediation. These are the two main steps in the vulnerability management lifecycle. Nessus Essentials was used to scan local VMs hosted on VMware Workstation to run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation. <br />


<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>VMware Workstation Player 17</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>

This non-credentialed scan mostly provided information regarding things to be aware of on the network and 1 SMB signing request vulnerability ; I was not able to see what may actually be vulnerabilities. <br />

After running a credential scan I could see vulnerabilities that I could not see before. The vulnerabilities shown were for Internet explorer which is no longer supported.<br />

Installing an older version of Firefox created critical and high vulnerabilities on the network.<br />
